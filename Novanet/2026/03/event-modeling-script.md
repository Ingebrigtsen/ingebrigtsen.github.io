## [HOOK — 0:00–0:10]

Most software projects don't fail because of bad code.
They fail because the team built the wrong thing — or built the right thing, but nobody agreed on what it actually does.

---

## [PROBLEM — 0:10–0:25]

A product owner, a developer, and a domain expert sit in a meeting.
They all walk out thinking they understood each other.
Three weeks later, the code shows up — and reality proves otherwise.

That's expensive. And it's avoidable.

---

## [WHAT IS IT — 0:25–0:45]

Event Modeling is a way to design systems using a shared timeline.
Instead of describing what your system *is* — you describe what it *does*, as a story that unfolds over time.

It only uses three building blocks:
**Events** — things that happened.
**Commands** — things a user wants to do.
**Read Models** — how the system informs the user.

That's it.

---

## [WHY IT MATTERS — 0:45–1:05]

Every workflow in your system follows the same loop:
A command comes in, an event gets recorded, a read model gets updated.

The language of the model is the language of the business.
Developers, domain experts, product owners — everyone looks at the same canvas and understands it.
Not diagrams written by developers for developers. A shared blueprint for the whole team.

---

## [BUSINESS VALUE — 1:05–1:20]

And here's why this matters commercially:
Done right, Event Modeling keeps the cost of each new feature roughly constant — no matter how much has already been built.
That means reliable estimates, predictable delivery, and no more "it depends."
