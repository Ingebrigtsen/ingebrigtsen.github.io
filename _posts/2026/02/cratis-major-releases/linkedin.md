🚀 Excited to finally announce what we shipped a few weeks ago: Cratis Chronicle v15.0.0 and Arc v19.0.0!

We've been too busy building the future of event sourcing to properly announce these major releases - until now! 😅

Here's what's new:

✨ **Unified Read Model API** - one consistent way to work with projections and reducers
🔐 **TLS by Default** - production-ready security out of the box
🔒 **Built-in Authentication** - required auth for production clients and Workbench with built-in authority
⚡ **Performance Boost** - bulk writes and smart throttling for serious scalability
🛠️ **Workbench Time Machine** - debug your read models by stepping through time
🤖 **AI Integration** - bringing event sourcing to your AI assistant with MCP servers
📊 **Static Code Analysis** - catch issues at compile time across Chronicle and Arc
📚 **Revamped Documentation** - consistent, approachable, and comprehensive at cratis.io

But here's what I'm most excited about: our commitment to making event sourcing accessible through **exceptional tooling**. 

Great tooling is the key to adoption. Period. 🎯

That's why we're investing heavily in:

- The Chronicle Workbench for visualization and debugging
- AI-powered development workflows
- Continuous simplification and friction removal

Event sourcing should be easier and more enjoyable than traditional approaches - not harder. That's our mission.
