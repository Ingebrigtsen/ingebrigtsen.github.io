# Quick Blog Writing Guide - Einar's Style

Use this as a quick reference when writing or editing blog posts.

## Voice Checklist

- [ ] Using first-person ("I", "we", "my")
- [ ] Conversational and personal tone
- [ ] Honest about challenges and mistakes
- [ ] Share the story/journey, not just the solution

## Opening Patterns

Choose what fits the post:

- "It all started with..."
- "Let's face it..."
- "A while back..."
- "Back in [year/month]..."
- "Time flies when you have fun, they say..."

## Structure Checklist

- [ ] Clear title that reflects the actual content
- [ ] TL;DR section (for technical deep dives)
- [ ] Background/context before diving into solution
- [ ] Logical section headings
- [ ] Code examples with explanations (not just code dumps)
- [ ] Conclusion/Summary/Wrap-up section

## Language Reminders

**Use These:**

- Contractions: "it's", "don't", "I've", "we're"
- Casual phrases: "The thing is...", "Fair enough...", "Trust me..."
- Rhetorical questions to engage reader
- "IMO", "I would argue", "I think" for opinions

**Avoid These:**

- Overly formal language
- Academic tone
- Passive voice when active is clearer
- Unexplained jargon

## Content Flow

1. **Start with WHY**
   - Why does this matter?
   - What problem led to this?
   - What was the itch/need/challenge?

2. **Share the JOURNEY**
   - What did you try?
   - What didn't work?
   - What did you learn?

3. **Explain the SOLUTION**
   - How does it work?
   - Show code/diagrams when helpful
   - Explain trade-offs

4. **Wrap UP**
   - Summarize key points
   - Reflect on the experience
   - Point to next steps or additional resources

## Technical Content

**When Discussing Code/Tech:**

- Explain the problem BEFORE showing the solution
- Provide context for why something exists
- Acknowledge complexity when it's complex
- Link to documentation, repos, or related posts
- Use diagrams for complex flows (Mermaid)

**When Discussing Architecture:**

- Start with core values/principles
- Explain trade-offs openly
- Show dependency relationships
- Don't pretend everything is perfect

## Authenticity Markers

**Personal Experience:**

- Share actual stories from work/projects
- Mention specific timelines: "Back in December 2015..."
- Reference real projects: Chronicle, Cratis, Bifrost
- Admit when things took longer than expected

**Humble Moments:**

- "I know, very silly thing to do..."
- "Trust me, I'm not taking a high road here..."
- "To be honest..."
- "Turns out this was much harder than expected..."

**Learning Journey:**

- Acknowledge when your thinking changed
- Share what you learned from failures
- Value continuous learning and growth
- "We tried X, but it didn't work because..."

## Common Phrases Bank

### For Starting Sections:

- "So, what about [X] then..."
- "Now what?"
- "Let's face it..."
- "The thing is..."
- "Back to..."
- "Remember I said..."

### For Transitions:

- "Fair enough..."
- "However..."
- "Unfortunately..."
- "Funnily enough..."
- "Turns out..."
- "The second thing..."

### For Conclusions:

- "In conclusion..."
- "Wrapping up..."
- "Summary"
- "Now what?"
- "Moving forward..."

## DevEx Focus

When writing about developer experience:

- Use "lovable APIs" language
- Mention "pit of success"
- Emphasize making it "easy to do right, hard to do wrong"
- Focus on consistency and sane defaults
- Value developer productivity
- Personal pleasure in helping other devs

## Examples

### Good Opening:

```markdown
It all started with an itch, as it always does. I've been using VSCode 
as my primary code editor ever since its release in 2015. Being a C# 
developer in that ecosystem has been a bit of a bumpy ride...
```

### Good Honest Reflection:

```markdown
I've been holding back on telling the world for quite some time, trying 
to polish everything as much as we could before speaking more about things. 
I know, very silly thing to do, just get it out there!
```

### Good Technical Explanation:

```markdown
We tried out a bunch of different solutions but ended up using ILRepack 
with the ILRepack.Lib.MSBuild.Task on top. It provided the flexibility 
we needed for this to work. However, it didn't provide us with all the 
magic we needed.
```

### Good Value Statement:

```markdown
Creating something that is lovable, hard to do wrong and putting developers 
in the pit of success is hard work. And to be honest, it should be. We 
should take pride in creating things that are to be used by others.
```

## Final Check Before Publishing

- [ ] Does it sound like a person talking, not a manual?
- [ ] Have you shared the "why" behind decisions?
- [ ] Are mistakes and learnings acknowledged?
- [ ] Is technical content accessible yet accurate?
- [ ] Does it help other developers?
- [ ] Would you enjoy reading this yourself?

**Remember:** Write like you're sharing hard-won wisdom with a colleague over coffee. Be the experienced developer who's honest about the journey, not just proud of the destination.
